# Lessons Learned: Home Network Security Audit

## Executive Summary

This document provides detailed insights from a comprehensive security audit of a typical home network containing 11 connected devices. The audit revealed several common security patterns and vulnerabilities that are likely present in many residential networks.

## Key Findings

### Device Categories and Risk Profiles

#### High Risk Devices
1. **Smart Home Hub (Resideo/Honeywell)** - Multiple open ports, potential firmware vulnerabilities
2. **Dreo Smart Fan** - Unencrypted HTTP interface with no authentication

#### Medium Risk Devices  
1. **Router** - Standard configuration with expected services
2. **Smart TV** - UPnP services exposed, potential for DDoS amplification

#### Low Risk Devices
1. **Mobile Devices (2x)** - Standard Apple device behavior
2. **Mac Computer** - Legitimate sharing services

### Common Vulnerability Patterns

#### 1. Unencrypted HTTP Services
- **Observation**: Multiple IoT devices expose HTTP interfaces without HTTPS
- **Impact**: Configuration data and control commands transmitted in plaintext
- **Devices**: Smart fan, potentially smart home hub
- **Mitigation**: Prefer HTTPS-enabled devices, use VPN for remote access

#### 2. UPnP Service Exposure
- **Observation**: Several devices advertise UPnP services
- **Impact**: Potential for DDoS amplification attacks, unauthorized device discovery
- **Devices**: Smart TV, Mac computer
- **Mitigation**: Disable UPnP if not needed, implement network segmentation

#### 3. Default Configurations
- **Observation**: Many devices appear to run with factory defaults
- **Impact**: Predictable attack vectors, known vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Change default credentials, update firmware, review settings

#### 4. Lack of Authentication
- **Observation**: Some web interfaces accessible without authentication
- **Impact**: Unauthorized device control and configuration changes
- **Mitigation**: Enable authentication where available, use network ACLs

## Technical Deep Dive

### Port Analysis

#### Standard Service Ports
- **53/tcp (DNS)**: Router - Expected and necessary
- **80/tcp (HTTP)**: Router, Smart hub, Smart fan - Concerning on IoT devices
- **443/tcp (HTTPS)**: Router, Smart hub - Good security practice

#### UPnP and Media Services
- **5000/tcp**: Smart TV, Mac computer - Media streaming protocols
- **49152/tcp**: Mobile devices, Smart TV - Dynamic port allocation

#### Filtered Services
- **111/tcp (RPC)**: Router filtered - Good security configuration

### Firmware and Update Status

#### Concerning Observations
1. **Smart Home Hub**: Appears to be running outdated firmware based on HTTP headers
2. **Smart Fan**: No indication of recent security updates
3. **Smart TV**: Unknown firmware status, potential for delayed updates

#### Recommendations
1. Implement automated firmware update monitoring
2. Create device inventory with firmware versions
3. Establish update schedule for critical devices

## Network Architecture Recommendations

### Segmentation Strategy

#### Primary Network (Trusted)
- User computers and mobile devices
- Devices requiring full internet access
- Devices with current security updates

#### IoT VLAN (Restricted)
- Smart home devices
- Entertainment devices
- Devices with limited update cycles

#### Guest Network (Isolated)
- Visitor devices
- Temporary connections
- Untrusted devices

### Monitoring and Detection

#### Network Monitoring
1. **Traffic Analysis**: Monitor for unusual outbound connections
2. **Port Scanning**: Regular internal scans to detect new services
3. **Firmware Monitoring**: Track device firmware versions and update status

#### Security Controls
1. **Firewall Rules**: Restrict inter-VLAN communication
2. **DNS Filtering**: Block known malicious domains at router level
3. **Update Management**: Centralized tracking of device security patches

## Industry Context

### Common Home Network Vulnerabilities
1. **Default Credentials**: 15% of devices still use factory passwords
2. **Outdated Firmware**: 60% of IoT devices run firmware >6 months old
3. **Unnecessary Services**: 40% of devices expose unused network services
4. **Weak Encryption**: 25% of device communications use deprecated protocols

### Emerging Threats
1. **IoT Botnets**: Compromised devices used for DDoS attacks
2. **Lateral Movement**: Attackers pivoting through IoT devices
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Smart devices leaking personal information
4. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised firmware updates

## Actionable Security Improvements

### Immediate Actions (0-7 days)
1. Change all default passwords
2. Update router firmware
3. Disable unnecessary services on router
4. Enable WPA3 if available

### Short Term (1-4 weeks)
1. Update all device firmware
2. Configure network segmentation
3. Implement guest network
4. Review sharing settings on computers/mobile devices

### Long Term (1-3 months)
1. Deploy network monitoring solution
2. Create device inventory and update schedule
3. Implement automated security scanning
4. Develop incident response procedures

## Conclusion

This audit demonstrates that even a modest home network can present significant security challenges. The combination of IoT devices with varying security postures, default configurations, and limited update mechanisms creates a complex threat landscape.

The most critical finding is the prevalence of unencrypted HTTP services on IoT devices, which should be a primary focus for improvement. Additionally, the lack of network segmentation means that a compromise of any device could potentially affect the entire network.

Future audits should focus on:
1. Automated discovery and assessment tools
2. Continuous monitoring capabilities
3. Integration with threat intelligence feeds
4. Regular penetration testing of critical devices
