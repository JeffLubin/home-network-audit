# Service Analysis:
# - UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) service exposed on port 5000
# - Two high-numbered ports (49152, 49153) with unknown services
# - Likely related to media streaming and device discovery protocols
# - Device appears to be advertising services for media sharing/casting

# Security Concerns:
# - UPnP services can be exploited for DDoS amplification attacks
# - Unknown services on high ports may expose device management interfaces
# - No authentication visible on exposed services
# - Device may be discoverable by other network clients

# Recommendations:
# - Disable UPnP if not needed
# - Review device's network settings for unnecessary services
# - Consider placing device on isolated VLAN
